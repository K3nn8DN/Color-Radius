the game has 2 phases
   setup
   place pebbles
   playing card
   moving pebble
   end game



first the model is made it does its own thing with no inputs
then the view os made same thing
then the controller is made with them as inputs

the controller constructor sets the controller for both as a listener
for the model and the view

after everything is set it auto sends the view to start displaying the start game menu

the player presses a board and a number of cards then sends to controller start game

the controller start game takes in the board and list of panels and send the info to the
model setup method

the model setup makes a grid using a list of colors to change the color of the panels, a
unused pebble list, a hand list and updates hand size

grid : made with a width and height has  a map of coordainate to panel
pebble : has a color

view shows the grid by looping through each panel if it has a pebble it shows a dot of that color
it also gets the color

panel : has a coordinate, a color and a pebble

view shows  the pebble list
to show it loops through the list and shows it as a pannel at the bottom of the screen and this
pannel is a seperate kind that when clicked sends what was clicked and updates the last clicked
component in controller


view places pebles by on click a panle it sends itself to the controller
 the controller checks if if its pebble placing phase then if the pebble can be placed here if so
 it calls pebble.setCoordinate(x,y)

after all pebbles are placed phase changes to playing card phase "choose a card to apply to the
last moved piece"



how to set up reorganizing the board
     when pannels are removed that panel turns black and has the feild isRemoved to be true
     when there are enogh removed go through and redo? them
        map.put("removed one", map.get("object two")); then map.remove
